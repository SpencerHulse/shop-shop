# shop-shop

## Description

This is a React e-commerce app that uses GraphQL on the back-end, along with Apollo Server and MongoDB via Mongoose. It also accesses global state using the React Context API. The main focus of my work was getting a shopping card up and running, including using indexedDB for persistence and Stripe to handle payments on the site.

A live version of the app can be found on [Heroku](https://shop-shop-stripe.herokuapp.com/).
